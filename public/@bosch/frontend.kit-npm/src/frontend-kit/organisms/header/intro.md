The header is meant to be the first, or topmost, element of every page. It features

* Up to three quicklinks / quick actions (check mobile viewport for space restrictions)
* Optionally, one if the quick actions can be a search
* A navigation with up to three levels
* optional breadcrumbs
* an optional subbrand identifier

Please note that the search functionality is a visual placeholder. The rest of the header is powered by markup and does not have a JS API.
Search results may appear misplaced depending on the container the component is placed in. It's recommended parent container to be with <code>position: relative</code>.
